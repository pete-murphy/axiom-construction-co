Tim has a long construction history dating back to the early 90's.
After completing a carpentry/construction management course at vocational school, he graduated from Franklin Institute of Engineering Boston with a major in Civil Engineering.
Post-college, Tim started a small construction company in the Boston area and remodeled hundreds of multi-family units for one of the largest residential real estate owners in the area.

At this time, the city life and young family drew him to Cape Cod.
He soon found a construction supervisor position with J.K. Scanlan where he ran large commercial projects on Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard and all across the Cape.
After 5 years, a change of pace was needed and Tim landed a construction supervisor position with the highly regarded Polhemus Savery DaSilva Architects/Builders where he built several trophy homes per year.

Then came the downturn of '08, and rather than become a victim of the lack of construction he went and became a certified solar installer and founded [SunWind, LLC](https://www.sunwindllc.com/) (an affiliate of Axiom Construction Company) and started on a new path embracing alternative energy since 2009.
As the owner of SunWind, Tim and his team installed thousands of solar projects across New England.

Again, looking ahead at the changing landscape Tim felt the solar industry would be slowing down and he needed to get back to his roots, thus started Axiom Construction Company.

With almost 30 years in residential and commercial construction, Tim and the team at Axiom Construction are capable of successfully completing any residential to medium-size commercial construction projects.
